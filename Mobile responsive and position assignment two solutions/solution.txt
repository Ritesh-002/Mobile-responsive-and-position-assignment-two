In CSS, z-index is a property that controls the stacking order of positioned elements. When elements overlap on a web page, the z-index property determines which elements appear on top of others. The higher the z-index value, the closer the element is to the front (or top) of the stacking order.
Why Use z-index?
1. Layering Elements
2. Modal Windows and Overlays
3. Stacking Context
